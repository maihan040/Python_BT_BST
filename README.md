# Python_BIN_BST_Lib

## Purpose:

This is an implementation of a binary tree and a binary search tree written in Python. 
Goal of this project is to build a fundamental set of binary tree operations and through inheritance have a binary search tree inherit
applicable methods.

## Motivation:

Motivation for this project was twofold: 
  
  * Bullet list Learn to become proficient with git/github
  * Bullet list Provide a resource of Python tied together with popular Computer Science concepts
  * Bullet list Extend on what was done in the "Python_BST_LIB"

## Tech/framework used:

  * Bullet list Python version 3.8.5
 
## Features:

  Code will have heavy documentation throughout, which serves to clearly show the operation of each function/class.
  Relevant sections are clearly marked, to make it easer for readers to understand the flow of the overall design
