# Python_BIN_BST_Lib

## Purpose:

This is an implementation of a binary tree and a binary search tree written in Python. 
Goal of this project is to build a fundamental set of binary tree operations and through inheritance have a binary search tree inherit
applicable methods.

## Motivation:

Motivation for this project was twofold: 
  
  * Bullet list Learn to become proficient with git/github
  * Bullet list Provide a resource of Python tied together with popular Computer Science concepts
  * Bullet list Extend on what was done in the "Python_BST_LIB"

## Tech/framework used:

  * Bullet list Python version 3.8.5
 
## Features:

  Code will have heavy documentation throughout, which serves to clearly show the operation of each function/class.
  Relevant sections are clearly marked, to make it easer for readers to understand the flow of the overall design

## Contents:
  
  * BT.py - module which contains the binary tree class along with all the methods that operate on that class 
  * BST.py - module which contains the binary search tree class along with all the methods that operate on that class  
  * Node.py - module which contains the node class that's used by both a binary tree, and a binary search tree
  * BT_Driver.py - driver module to test both binary tree and binary search tree classes
  * BT_Functions.py - module which has methods that can be used by both binary tree, as well as binary search tree objects
